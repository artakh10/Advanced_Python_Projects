Our databases resemble a huge Excel file with columns, rows, and fields.
Very matrice-like. These are the classic SQL databases.
BUT! If I want to establish a huge sales website,
I will have to make a database, for example., the goods' name, color, RAM size, hard size, etc.
E.g., I have a Lenovo laptop that is blue, has 8 GB RAM and 500 GB hard.
But if someone says, " hey, I have a doll I want to sell, " this database won't work efficiently anymore.
Thus, I have to add two other columns, model and weight.
If someone says I have a book I want to sell, those columns won't work for it either.
So, we need a more efficient database. Here's where NoSQL comes in.

NoSQL is efficient in its ability to handle multiple database types,
is agile and has the ability to work on very large scales.

'''
Database types: 
I) Document Store: saves multiple goods with different columns.
It's as if I'm storing multiple documents. I am not specifying the fields.
II) Graph Databases: For social media
III) Key-value stores: Like Python dictionaries: A:B & C:D
IV) Wild Column: Cassandra and Redis and Hpace
MongoDB: Dynamic Schema
* To connect Python and Mongo, we can use the pymono package.
